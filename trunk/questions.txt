Event: 2141 Question: 2356
why didnt the coaches put the offense (crompton) in positions to be successful  i know there was pressure and dropped passes   but no roll outs, no hot reads or quick passes  it seems as though many of the passes crompton attempted were to recievers fairly well covered   which goes back to poor scheming    it seems as though ucla saw some things at halftime, made great adjustments, , and went to short passes, quick drops, and moved the ball very effectively   i was expecting ut to make the same adjustments and it never came

after watching randall cobb, former alcoa star, quarterback kentucky last night, i was wondering how coach fullmer let him get away --harrogate fan

Event: 2152 Question: 2268
hey guys, on the blocked punt, it looked like we were in a new punt formation  wide splits, not many guys on the line  3 or 4 guys from ucla broke through the line  any one of them could have blocked the ball  i've seen one man break through and block a punt, but i can't remember ever seeing a breakdown in the offensive line like this  how could we have such a weak play on the punt team

the bottom line- first half chow d, chavis c (c only because of the blocked punt), clausen c  second half chow a- , clausen c chavis d- players made individual mistakes but i believe the grading above is what made the difference  i am chavis's number one fan but he had chow knowing and gaining knowledge and got outfoxed from halftime on analysis, many defensive coordinators call prevent formations instead of playing to their own strengths because they dont believe the quarterback can hit six passes in a row  when they do hit six passes in a row , they beat you

Event: 2154 Question: 2553
it all boils down to discipline or lack there of   these guys are on scholorship--its like a job in my opinion  and if they can't perform the job, give somebody else a try   these players are suppose to be the best or close to it and they are not proving themselves both on the field and off hte field   also, just returned from vacation in florida - seminole territory and they too are frustrated with bowden   talked with some folks and they feel he will be there until he decides to retire   just like fulmer   very frustrating   he and his coaching staff were obviously out-coached yesterday   they may be lucky to win 2 more games

Event: 2155 Question: 2703
what is our recruiting looking like

Event: 2155 Question: 2704
why is jonathan crompton still playing after his horrible appearances in our games  when will they bench him

Event: 2155 Question: 2705
why can't crompton get his mind into the game  cbs said that he has his mind on the cheerleaders

Event: 2155 Question: 2706
fulmer was an excellent offensive coordinator  why doesn't he take over the offense and call plays himself  this is obviously way over clawson's head

Event: 2155 Question: 2708
do you think attendance will be drastically down for the n ill  game

Event: 2155 Question: 2709
it is my understanding that ut was off to a great start for the '09 recruiting season  i also understand there's a top quarterback from california that had committed to ut that has now de-commited  in light of all the tv exposure of possibly the poorest offense to ever be fielded don't you think our recruiting is going to drop drastically

Event: 2155 Question: 2712
has anyone checked crompton's eyesight  it seems like he consistently overthrows his receivers  could that be what the problem is

Event: 2155 Question: 2713
i don't understand why don't they let g  jones throw the ball  he can't do as bad as crompton right now

Event: 2155 Question: 2714
i understand we've hit hard times, but how many busted plays can we have in one game   crompton has no rapport with his receivers   there were many occasions where the quarterback and receiver were on totally different pages  what's going on

Event: 2155 Question: 2715
how many chances will fulmer give crompton  he has already proven over and over he is not capable of leading us to a victory over a quality opponent  i know stevens our backup qb isn't the greatest, but he couldn't do any worse   it's time for a change

Event: 2155 Question: 2717
since will is a former football player maybe he can answer why crompton and foster are having so much difficulty in executing a basic hand off play and especially in such critical parts of the field that result in game changing plays

Event: 2155 Question: 2718
any comment from the panel regarding that after the auburn game, it's painfully obvious that a combination of continually nervous hands, repeatedly not seeing the entire field as in wide open receivers in the qb game, almost inept team mistakes and oversights that are hard for high-school players to mess up, and the coaches not allowing the trademark medium and long bombs to loosen defenses that used to be a tennessee trademark   with all this working against the vols, even the network tv people were moaning about this not only in the auburn game

Event: 2155 Question: 2719
i think it is time to remind people  that it is kids playing the games and not paid professionals   i am all orange and i love to win but people must remember the first concern is their classes and life after football   the football games should be fun win or lose, maybe if the coach did not get a ceo type salary there could be a focus on football

Event: 2155 Question: 2720
brent hubbs has said multiple times before that he would be for duke if we were to play them  do you think that we would beat duke and coach david cutcliffe if we were to play them this year

Event: 2155 Question: 2723
is arian foster the best tailback we have how many games is he going to cost the team before  fulmer decides to bench him

Event: 2155 Question: 2724
ultimately, fulmer is responsible for the teams current situation because a) he refuses to pull crompton who is not showing any signs of improvement and b) he is the one that should be making sure our players are much more focused than what they are   i would like your responses to this please

Event: 2155 Question: 2725
do you think this will be the year a moving van shows up at the coaches house as it has in th past

Event: 2155 Question: 2726
does fulmer deserve to still be coaching this team

Event: 2155 Question: 2727
it's obvious by now that if you pressure johnathon crompton, the most likely result is an incomplete pass  teams will stack up against the run and dare us to pass, but we can't  the guy is our achilles heel, and i realize that we don't have much in the way of experience behind him, but it's time to give someone else a chance  i can't recall a ut quarterback ever stinking it up so consistently

Event: 2155 Question: 2728

fulmer and kesling skipped right over the crompton fumble on this morning's phillip fulmer show as if it never happened  i also noticed that the show didn't air at all after the ucla game  what's up with this  is fulmer trying to coddle the players by protecting them from the reality of how bad this team is, or does he think if he ignores the truth long enough it will go away

Event: 2155 Question: 2732
can you please grade dave clausens play calling through the first 4 games and do you think fulmer will step in and be more involved in the offensive gameplan   and will they change quarterbacks    i heard crompton say he was not allowed to check off and i fault clausen for that     this is not div ii it's the sec and qb's need to be able to checkoff    (i still think we need a quarterback change though)

Event: 2155 Question: 2733
in your opinion (announcers), was the fumble crompton's or folster's fault

Event: 2155 Question: 2734
hey i was wondering why the university doesnt get rid of fulmer  he has had his chance to prove himself but i think that if tennessee plans on winning they need a new coaching staff and need to recruit better  unless you don't want to have a 1998 season next year because this year we wont even be in a bowl game

Event: 2155 Question: 2735

Event: 2155 Question: 2740
why do they refuse to use brandon warren more, also, no matter how bad our team is right now a true fan sticks with the team thru thick and thin and never leaves a ball game   just look at the georgia fans last night   no one left until right at the end of the game event though they were 31 points behind at the half   you can bet that every recruit looks at the fan base and their reactions and at this rate we will never get a top player again

Event: 2155 Question: 2741
why is dave clawson our offensive cordinator and why isnt stevenson our quarterback -john anderson

Event: 2155 Question: 2742

Event: 2155 Question: 2753
